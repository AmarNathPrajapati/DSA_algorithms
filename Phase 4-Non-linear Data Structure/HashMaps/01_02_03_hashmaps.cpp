/*hashmap is a data structure.
it store the value in the form of key and value, key should be unique.
insertion, deletion and search take 0(1) time complexity for the unordered map
for the ordered map the time required by above operations are O(log(N))
time complexity is depends whether haspmap is implemented by which data structure.
it can be implemented using linked list, BST and hashtable.
for more follow the notes
